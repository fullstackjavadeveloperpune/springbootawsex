Deploying Spring Boot JAR File on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk

AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):
AWS EC2 provides scalable virtual servers (instances) to run applications. It gives full control over the operating system and resources, allowing customization, direct server management, and hosting applications in the cloud.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk:
Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for deploying and managing applications. It handles infrastructure provisioning, scaling, and monitoring while you focus on writing code. You simply upload your application, and it automates deployment and operations.
